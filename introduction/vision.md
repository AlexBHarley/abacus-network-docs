# Vision

We believe the next era of interoperability will be defined by interchain applications that are natively interoperable across blockchains, and that do not defer any of this responsibility to their users.

### Interchain applications

Interchain applications will communicate natively across chains, meeting users and assets on the chains where they are, while bringing along nonlocal network effects.&#x20;

Despite access from multiple chains, interchain applications will present a unified state to their users, obviating chain-specific UX. Interchain applications will be truly interoperable across blockchains, strengthening the accessibility and composability that have made decentralized applications successful to date and solving a core challenge which has limited their growth and virality.

At Abacus, we are working to bring the blockchain world into the era of interchain applications.

### Protocol and platform

Realizing this vision will require more than generic message passing protocols; it will require entire ecosystems to emerge around building interchain applications.

To that end, the long term Abacus vision is to become a one-stop deployment platform, where developers write and deploy their applications only once to get the combined benefits of all supported chains.

We recognize that this requires a monumental investment of time, effort, and resources. As we work towards that vision, we will be releasing incremental versions of Abacus that allow any developer to deploy an Abacus app that acts as the connective tissue between all of their existing deployments on supported chains.
