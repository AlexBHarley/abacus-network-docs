description: Interchain applications, the next era of interoperability

# Vision

We believe the upcoming era of interoperability will be defined by interchain applications, in which applications, rather than users, will be responsible for interoperability.

### Interchain applications

Interchain applications will communicate natively across chains, meeting users and assets on the chains where they are already.

Despite being compatible with multiple chains, interchain applications will be able to present a single, unified, state to their users, as opposed to requiring a per-chain UX. Interchain applications will allow for true interoperability across blockchains, strengthening the accessibility and composability that has made decentralized applications so successful to date.

At Abacus, we are working to bring the blockchain world into the era of interchain applications.

### Protocol and platform

Realizing this vision will require more than generic message passing protocols; it will require entire ecosystems to emerge around building interchain applications.

To that end, the long term vision is for Abacus to become a one-stop deployment platform, where a developer only needs to write and deploy their application once to get the combined benefits of all Abacus supported chains.

We recognize that this will require a massive investment of time, effort, and resources. As we work towards that vision, we will be releasing versions of Abacus that allow any developer to deploy an Abacus app that acts as the connective tissue between all of their existing deployments on supported chains.
